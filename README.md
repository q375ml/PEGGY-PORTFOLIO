Hi, I’m Peggy Chiang, a Product Designer. I have been on many projects related to Web / UI interface design.
For the past 5 years, I have focused on UI / UX design logic, data application, and exploring streamlined design and meaningful user experience.

I like teamwork, can help the team solve problems and together the complete goal is to keep my passion.
