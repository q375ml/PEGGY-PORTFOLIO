            <h4>Description－</h4>
            <p class="pt-2">
              The 2020 Digital Transformation Tourism Revitalization Training and Education Project cooperates with the government for digital transformation. The main trainers are employees of the travel industry, tourism hotel industry, hotel industry and tourism industry. Due to the epidemic situation, the original physical courses have been changed to online teaching courses. <br /><br />
              Therefore, the motivation to use it is to strengthen the training of relevant heavy industry personnel to complete the classroom projects and hours, not only to improve skills and obtain relevant licenses, but also to catch up with digital transformation and meet market needs. The application level of the original communication system is further expanded to improve the overall operating experience.<br /><br />
              
              <b>This project starts from the user's point of view, uses user research, and takes the situational needs as the first stage of planning.</b>

                Considering that engineers need a UI component library afterwards, the UI system is also sorted out. <br />

                , in the case of insufficient development time, the open source UI component library will be used to develop front-end screen directly in VScode.<br>
                After the flowchart is drawn, the confirmation function is no problem. Enter VScode and use HTML, SCSS, and simple JS to make dynamic and assist engineers in subsequent production.
