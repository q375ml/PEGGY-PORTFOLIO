            <h5>The Problem</h5>
            <p class="pt-2">
              As a result of the pandemic, the courses have transitioned from in-person to online format.
              Therefore, the motivation to use it is to strengthen the training of relevant heavy industry personnel to complete the classroom projects and hours, not only to improve skills and obtain relevant licenses, but also to catch up with digital transformation and meet market needs.
            </p>
            <h5>The First Phase Objective</h5>
            <p class="pt-2">
              Offer a B2B communication system application with a video-based online teaching platform. Targeted users include tourism development associations, licensed tour leaders/guides, and professionals in the hotel, tourism, and entertainment industries. It accommodates classroom learning and self-study situations.
            </p>
            <h5>User Story</h5>

            <p>After finalizing the Wireframes, the visual design process begins. The desired style is fresh, clean, concise, comfortable, stable, and technological, with defined elements and colors. Adobe XD is used for intuitive UI design, facilitating user goal achievement. Additionally, a UI component library is organized for future use by engineers.
