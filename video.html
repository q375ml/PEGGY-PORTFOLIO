            <p class="pb-20 f20">
              Taiwan Tourism Bureau Online Educational Platform. This initiative targets the travel, tourism, and hotel industries. Due to the pandemic preventing in-person courses, the project aims to enhance online training to facilitate personnel in completing certificate programs.
            </p>
            <img src="images/OnlineClass.svg" alt="" class="pt-3 pic" />
            <h5>My Role</h5>
            <p class="pt-2 pb-2">Senior UI/UX designer.</p>
            <ul class="pt-2 ab_txt">
              <li>Collaborating with diverse stakeholders, product managers, and engineers to identify issues and offer solutions.</li>
              <li>Creating an end-to-end UX/UI design process, solutions and executing them.</li>
              <li>Collaborating with front-end colleagues on HTML & CSS (SCSS), while utilizing Bootstrap resources, to define CSS components.</li>
              <li>Developing frontend UI and backend UI, and utilizing effective element plugins to save development time.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>The Problem</h5>
            <p class="pt-2">
              During the pandemic, professionals who were originally required to attend in-person classes had to switch to online courses to complete their course projects and training.<br><br>

              At that time, the platform did not offer the necessary features. Therefore, the goal of this project was to construct an online teaching platform. It aimed to provide specific online course functionalities tailored to different users, including teachers, students, and administrators, enabling them to smoothly conduct online courses.
            </p>
            
            <h5 class="pb-2">The Key Design</h5>
            <p>The frontend primarily consists of the interface for teachers and students.</p>
            <ul class="">
              <h4>Teacher view</h4>
              <p class="pt-2 pb-2">
                Teachers can choose to add students and share presentations during the teaching process.
              </p>

              <h4>Student view</h4>
              <p class="pt-2 pb-2">
                Students can raise their hands and ask questions during classes.
              </p>
              <li class="pt-2 pb-2"> <img src="images/video-student.svg" alt="" width="100%" class="" /></li>
             
              <h4>Multi person view</h4>
              <p class="pt-2 pb-2">
                Both teachers and students can switch between different views for convenient observation.
              </p>
              <li class="pt-2 pb-2"><img src="images/video-Multi-person view.svg" alt="" width="100%" class="" /></li>
             
              <h4>Message view</h4>
              <p class="pt-2 pb-2"> 
                Students can directly ask questions during class, reducing the chances of missing out on questions.
              </p>

            <p class="py-2">
              Offering a B2B communication system application through a video-based online teaching platform, designed for use by various stakeholders:

            <p class="pt-2">
              UI workflows for teachers, students, and managers outline each step on the screen, scenarios encountered, and actions taken. This aids engineers in understanding the process, verifying the smoothness of user interactions, defining interactions, and displaying various error messages for different states.

              I also contributed to the engineering work in this project, the key contribution I had blowe referencing and made the UI compent of the use css and html , referencing resources from <a href="https://element.eleme.io/#/en-US" target="_blank">https://element.eleme.io/#/en-US</a>.
              This included suggesting UI components for the Internal facing portal, which helped reduce the development time for the engineering team.

            <p class="pt-20 pb-3">
              When designers face challenges in understanding and solving problems, they often encounter very ambiguous situations. I assist stakeholders from various departments in reaching consensus, clarifying the direction of the problem, and moving forward by analyzing user assumptions, usage scenarios, and using service flowcharts. <br/><br/>
              Throughout the production process, I help the engineering team establish an effective backend user interface, a skill I have learned on my own, which allows me to efficiently complete projects. Effective teamwork is a highly satisfying achievement for me.
